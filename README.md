# html-portfolio
This repository serves as my very first website with the purpose of being my Web Dev portfolio in which I plan on using HTML, CSS, JS, and their various frameworks to complete it.
I will be challenging myself to not only complete the website in it's entirety, but to also ensure that it is responsive and serves as a great metric of my progress as a Web Developer.
