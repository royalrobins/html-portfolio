<p>My name is Royal Robins and I am Full-Stack Web Developer with 4+ Months of experience building personal projects and utilizing various frameworks to achieve the desired outcomes. Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana I received my education in Lafayette, Louisiana attending the University of Louisiana at Lafayette for both Undergrad studies & Graduate studies. 
I completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree specializing in Computer Arts & Animation in 2017 and completed my Masters of Science degree specializing in Informatics in 2024. Throughout my years of study, figuring out my professional passion have been a challemge. Starting out my professional career as a UX/UI designer, I realized that I was wanting to do more. 
This sparked a career change to explore the path of Information Technology in 2022 which is why I decided to pursue a MS in Informatics. My love for technology and its infrastrcuture has led me to acquire 4+ YOE in the field of Information Technology. However, despite this experience I have never felt satisfied with the work I've done. 
I began to look inward to figure out why that's the case for both career paths since I was and am very good at what I do/did. This is when I began to code. Since learning the concepts of data structures, algorithms, and coding languages, I feel as though the world has gotten brighter. I began to learn to code utilizing Python as my starting lamguage and PyCharm as the IDE.
From there, I learned general syntax and code structure. From that point on, I knew what my passion and purpose in this world would be. I'm particularly drawn to Web Development since I can utlilize both skills acquired from higher education and professional experience to create things that everyone can enjoy and/or use whether it's a website or web-app.
