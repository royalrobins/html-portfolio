<h2>Royal's Top 3 Best Call of Duty Video Games</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 1</h3>

<p>Black Ops 1 is the best cod game in my opinion due to the refreshing multiplayer, gut-wrenching campaign, and ground-breaking zombies.</p>

<h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 2</h3>

<p>Black Ops 2 did what Black Ops 1 did but BETTER!</p>

<h3>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</h3>

<p>Modern Warfare 2 paved the way for many modern shooters and was game of the year.</p>
